 *   The node entity with limited access to object properties and methods.
 *   * Methods: Only "getter" methods (method names starting with "get", "has", or "is")
 *     and a few common methods such as "id" and "label" are available.
 *     {{ node.getTitle }} : the Node title ( == {{ title }} )
 *     Calling other methods (such as node.delete) will result in an exception.
 *   * Properties: field values can be accessed as follows:

 *   be used for multiple subscribers. If you created personalized newsletters
 *   and can't use tokens for that, make sure to disable caching or write a
 *   custom caching strategy implemention.
